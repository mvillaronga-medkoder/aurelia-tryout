# aurelia-tryout
Work with new aurelia framework to test its viability within the normal medkoder architecture.

Based off of the documentation at http://aurelia.io/docs.html and http://aurelia.io/get-started.html.  

It may advance to integrating with the medkoder architecture after the intial getting starteds are up and running.
